# Hangman-Solver-Python
A simple hangman solver created using python. The algorithm works by going through the list of words and finding the frequency of letters from the list of words. From this information, the order of letters to guess is created and updated as letters which are in and not in the word are found. The hangman game was created using the [Hangman API](https://github.com/despo/hangman).  

Running the main.py file will execute the algorithm and show the guesses being made and whether the solver correctly guessed the word in the amount of attempts.
